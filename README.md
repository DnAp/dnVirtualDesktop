__Change Log:__  
v1.0.26  
--You can now use the number keys above the letters in addtion to the numpad  
--You can also create any hotkey you'd like by overriding defaults  
--Open a file with a hotkey - any file (Application, image, text, and even a URL..just include the http:// or https:// when tryping it)  
--Use the "Disable Default" hotkey type to disable a Windows default hotkey (for me that is WIN+Left or Right)
--Settings file has been redesigned. It's much better, but you have to redo your settings....sorry

__Installation__  
This program uses `IsolatedStorage` for the settings file so in order for each new version to read the same settings file it is important that the program be unzipped and run from the same location everytime.

It's preferable to run directly from the `Startup` folder

You can get to the `Startup` folder by typing `Startup` into the address bar of any Windows Explorer window. Simply copy the file into that folder.

__Supported Versions__  
I'm currently running this app perfectly on version:  
Version 1607 (OS Build 14393.953)  

If the app doesn't work for you then I would first try getting Windows Updates and if that doesn't work then please open an issue with your version.

To find your version simply press <kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> then type WinVer into the box and hit enter.


__Features:__

__Hotkeys:__

These are the default hotkeys. You can configure these any way you'd like.

__Navigate Desktops:__  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Numpad</kbd>  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>NumberKeys</kbd>  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>LEFT</kbd> or <kbd>RIGHT</kbd> - this is Windows Default and can be overridden to allow "Round Robin"

The foreground window will be the window which moves  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>Numpad</kbd>  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>NumberKeys</kbd>  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>LEFT</kbd> or <kbd>RIGHT</kbd>

__What is the difference between pin app and pin window?__  
An easy way to imagine this is if you use `pin window` on a chrome browser window, 
only that window will be visible on all desktops. Any other chrome windows would 
stay on a single desktop. If you were to `pin application` on a chrome window then 
all chrome windows would show up on all desktops. This includes new chrome windows.

__System Tray Icon:__  
-Choose from several sets of icons  
-The icons indicate which desktop you are viewing  
-`Left-Click` the system tray icon to bring up the default Task View overlay.  
-`Double-Left-Click` the system tray icon to minimize all windows.  
-`Right-Click` the system tray icon to bring up the main menu.

Make your own icons and attach them to an issue then I will add them to the program.  
[How to submit icon files](https://github.com/mzomparelli/zVirtualDesktop/issues/23)

Download the current icons and alter ones you like. I ask that you come up with a name for your icon theme.

__Wallpapers:__  
-Set a different wallpaper for each desktop  
-Specify the style for each (Center, Stretch, or Tile)

__Move All Windows__  
I added a really handy feature which you can also create a hotkey for.
This feature lets you move all open windows across all desktops to the currently active desktop.
